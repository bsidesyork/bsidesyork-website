St.Olaves, part of St. Peters School

{{< alert icon="edit" >}}
Did you know St.Peters is the third oldest school in the world and was founded in AD627!

Over the years St.Peters has seen many famous students, but none quite as relevant as the man now synonymous with 
the hacker movement, **Guy Fawkes**!

<h3>Where are we?</h3>

BSIDES York is happening right in York City Center at St. Peters School!

Ok, kind of.  The St.Peters site contains a lot of buildings and we're specifically in St.Olaves school which contains 
a fully-equipped lecture theatre, cafeteria and a few other large classrooms to run the con!

<h3>How do I get there?</h3>

<h4>By car</h3>

We have free parking on site at St.Peters for around 80 cars and its strictly first-come, first-serve.  Enter the car park via Clifton road and follow the parking signs to the rear of the building.  There is a short, flat walk around the school green to St.Olaves (signposted). 

If the car park is full when you arrive then there is an expensive car park on Bootham road, called Bootham Car Park.

<h4>By Park'n'Ride / bus</h4>

York has brilliant transport links with 6 separate Park'n'Ride sites dotted around the edge of the City.

Parking is free and bus tickets into town are cheap.

<h4>By train</h4>

York has direct trains from London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, Doncaster and Peterborough!

BSIDES York is just a short 13-minute walk from the train station (0.6 miles).

<h4>By friend</h4>

If you have a friend, coerce them into driving and make it their problem!

<h3>Where can I stay?</h3>

[The Principal](https://theprincipalyork.com/) is not too far from the venue and has parking for hotel guests

[The Grand](https://www.thegrandyork.co.uk/) is a little further and has no parking, but it's perfect if you want something right in the center and even more luxury

<h3>Is the venue accessible</h3>

Yes!  ...mostly.  We are working with the school to ensure the majority of the conference is fully accessible, but unfortunately it's a very old building.  

The entire conference (main tracks, catering, kids track, and business hall) will take part on the ground floor, but there are some steps to enter and exit the building.  

If you have access concerns, please let us know ahead of time or at the door and we'll work with the facilities staff to open an alternate entrance.
